# .NET-III_final_project
This is my final project for my .NET III class at Kirkwood Community College. The main purpose of this class was to learn ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework.

For this project I took my .NET II project and added the MVC to make it into a web application. I also added a few new features, such as an administrator being able to add or remove roles
from a user.
